rumprun-packages-wip
====================

rumprun-packages-wip is a work-in-progress repository for software
running on the rumprun unikernel.  We are working towards a real
packaging system, and until we reach that point, this repo is meant to
assemble the instructions and patches for running various applications
on rumprun unikernels.

After we obtain a real packaging system, this repository will shift
purpose to hosting functional work which has not yet made it into
the packaging system.  In other words, it will become a repository for
work-in-progress packages instead of a repository for a work-in-progress
packaging system.
