# Overview

This is Node.js 4.2.4 LTS for Rumprun. Use any of the thousands of npm packages
or run your own Javascript modules on the Rumprun unikernel.

# Patches

The build process first applies the NetBSD pkgsrc patches for Node.js and then
applies patches from the `patches` directory.

There are a couple of changes worth noting:

- Rumprun doesn't have `execinfo.h` or `backtrace` so C stack traces for
  exceptions won't be printed.

- Rumprun doesn't support the `mmap(MAP_NORESERVE)` ... `mmap(MAP_FIXED)`
  combination for allocating code range memory so this has to be fixed when
  Node is launched. 16Mb is allocated for your code by default, which should
  be enough for small programs. If you need more, use the `--code-range-size`
  argument when you use `rumprun` to launch Node (e.g. `--code-range-size=64`).

# Instructions

Run `make`. This will produce `build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-default`, which you
can then pass to `rumprun-bake` &mdash; for example:

```shell
rumprun-bake hw_generic build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-default.bin build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-default
```

You can then run Node using something like this:

```shell
rumprun kvm -M 160 -i build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-default.bin
```

# Examples

The files `_third_party_main.js` and `rumpmain.js` in this directory are bundled
into `build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-default`. `_third_party_main.js` runs when
you launch Node using `rumprun`.

If you give an argument to `node-default.bin` when running `rumprun`, then
`_third_party_main.js` treats it as a pathname and runs the script in that file.
If you don't give an argument, it runs `rumpmain.js`, which just displays a
message and exits.

`rumpmain.js` ships as a symbolic link to `default.js`. You can of course link
`rumpmain.js` to a different file. Please note this will change the name of the
output binary too, based on the name of the file you link to. For example,
if you link `rumpmain.js` to `foo.js` then `make` will produce
`build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-foo`.

Most applications require code in separate modules, and you have three
options for running these.

## Separate filesystem

The first option is to put your application's files into a filesystem (e.g.
using `genisoimage`) and attach it to `rumprun` using the `-b` option. You can
then give the path to the main file of your application as an argument to
`rumprun`, after `node-default.bin`.

For instance, assuming Express is checked out into the `express` directory,
then to run the "Hello World" example:

```shell
(cd express; npm install --production)
genisoimage -l -r -o express.iso express/
rumprun kvm -M 160 -I 'nic,vioif,-net user,hostfwd=tcp::3000-:3000' -W nic,inet,dhcp -i -b express.iso,/express build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-default.bin /express/examples/hello-world/index.js
```

or in the `examples` directory:

```shell
make run_express_hello_world
```

Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Webpack/Browserify

The second option is to bundle your entire application into a single file,
and link `rumpmain.js` to it. You can do this using
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) or [browserify](http://browserify.org/).

For instance, to run the same Express "Hello World" example:

```shell
npm install webpack json-loader
(cd express; npm install --production)
./node_modules/.bin/webpack --target node --module-bind json ./express/examples/hello-world/index.js hello-world.js
ln -sf hello-world.js rumpmain.js
make
rumprun-bake hw_generic build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-hello-world.bin build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-hello-world
rumprun kvm -M 160 -I 'nic,vioif,-net user,hostfwd=tcp::3000-:3000' -W nic,inet,dhcp -i build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-hello-world.bin
```

This approach is fine for applications which are compatible with Webpack or
Browserify but larger applications can require quite a bit of tweaking.

## Ziploader

I've implemented a third option which works better with larger applications
(actually with any application).

First you Zip up your application. Then you run `zipload.sh`, passing the Zip
file as standard input and the name of the script inside the Zip file to run
as a parameter. `zipload.sh` will write a completely self-contained script to
standard output, which you can then save and link `rumpmain.js` to.

For example:

```shell
zip -r express.zip express
./zipload.sh ./express/examples/hello-world/index.js < express.zip > hello-world.js
ln -sf hello-world.js rumpmain.js
make
rumprun-bake hw_generic build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-hello-world.bin build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-hello-world
rumprun kvm -M 160 -I 'nic,vioif,-net user,hostfwd=tcp::3000-:3000' -W nic,inet,dhcp -i build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-hello-world.bin
```

or in the `examples` directory:

```shell
make bundle_express_hello_world
rumprun-bake hw_generic ../build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-hello-world.bin ../build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-hello-world
make run_bundled_express_hello_world
```

Behind the scenes, Node's `fs` module is monkey-patched to load modules and
files from the Zip file. The Zip file is written into the script as a
base64-encoded string and accessed using
[JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/), which is also bundled into the script.

## Baked-in disk image

Yes, this is the fourth of three options and isn't available yet!
Hopefully one day, Rumprun will be able to bake file system images into the
Rumpkernel binaries and mount them as virtual disks for applications to access.

# Native Addons

Some Node modules use Node.js native
[Addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html). These are compiled from C++ into
shared libraries, which Node loads at runtime.

Rumprun doesn't support dynamic loading of shared libraries so you'll see a
stacktrace like this if one of your modules tries to load an Addon:

```
Error: Service unavailable
    at Error (native)
    at Module.load (module.js:355:32)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:310:12)
    at Module.require (module.js:365:17)
    at require (module.js:384:17)
```

The solution is to compile the Addon into the Node binary itself. Whilst this
isn't something you usually do, it's quite simple. You need to add the full
pathnames of the Addon's source and header files to `build-4.2.4/node.gyp`.

- Either do this by hand:
  1. Add the source files to `targets`&rarr;`sources` 
  2. Add the header files to `targets`&rarr;`include_dirs`
  3. Run `make`
- Or use [`nad`](https://github.com/thlorenz/nad):
  1. `npm install -g nad`
  2. `cd /path/to/addon`
  2. `nad configure --nodedir /path/to/rumprun-packages/nodejs/build-4.2.4`
  3. `nad inject`
  4. Run `NODE_PATH=/path/to/addon/node_modules make`

The Addon is now compiled into the Node binary, which you can bake and run as
normal. Remember the Node binary will be `build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-default`
unless you've linked `rumpmain.js` to something other than `default.js`.

I've added an example of using an Addon in `examples/ursa/test.js`:

1. In the `examples` directory, run `make ursa.iso`. This installs the
   [`ursa`](https://github.com/quartzjer/ursa) module and adds it to a `.iso`
   file.
2. Next, you have to add `ursa`'s Addon to `build-4.2.4/node.gyp`.
  - Either modify `build-4.2.4/node.gyp` by hand:
    1. In `sources` (under `targets`), add `'../examples/ursa/node_modules/ursa/src/ursaNative.cc'`
    2. In `include_dirs` (under `targets`), add `'../examples/ursa/node_modules/ursa/node_modules/nan'`
    3. Run `make`
  - Or run `make inject_ursa` in the `examples` directory. This uses `nad` to
    modify `build-4.2.4/node.gyp` and then runs `make` with `NODE_PATH` set.
3. Bake the Node binary (e.g. `rumprun-bake hw_generic build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-default.bin build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-default`)
4. In the `examples` directory, run `make run_ursa`. You should see a
   PEM-formatted public key displayed.

A Serious Example
=================

I've got the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blogging platform running under
Rumprun:

```shell
cd examples
make bundle_ghost ghost_data.img
rumprun-bake hw_generic ../build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-ghost-0.7.5.bin ../build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-ghost-0.7.5 
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1024 -kernel ../build-4.2.4/out/Release/node-ghost-0.7.5.bin -drive if=virtio,file=ghost_data.img -net nic,model=virtio -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2368-:2368 -append '{"net": {"if": "vioif0",, "type": "inet",,  "method":"dhcp"},, "blk": {"source": "dev",, "path": "/dev/ld0a",, "fstype": "blk",, "mountpoint": "/ghost_data"},, "env": "GHOST_CONFIG=/ghost_data/config.js",, "cmdline": "node --code-range-size=64"}' 
```

Point your browser to [http://localhost:2368](http://localhost:2368)

The persistent data is kept in `ghost_data.img`.

Node 5
======

Node 5.3.0 is known to build successfully:

```shell
make NODE_VERSION=5.3.0 PKGSRC=nodejs
```

Known Issues
============

- If you use `nad` to inject more than one Addon into `build-4.2.4/node.gyp`,
  you might run into problems. You'll end up with conflicting definitions for
  `module_root_dir`, so if both the Addons rely on its value then one will
  fail to compile.
- It's best to use Node 4.2.4 (and associated `npm` version) on your build
  system when installing you application's dependencies.
